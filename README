### INTRODUCE

This project is depended on PIO and ros, we use rosserial_ardunio communicate with ros system. 

In this branch, we had tested on ROS 1 melodic | noetic, we code lib Control & Encoder which use to contorl wheel rotation & read encoder's data then in source code we use the API which ROS provided to send pose message and read velocity message.

This project hardware esp32 TB6612FNG PCF8574T and some LDO use to reduction voltage.

We use  PCF8574T to extend esp32 pins (ESP32 pins is to few !! :( !! ), it use IIC so we just use 2 extend 8 pins control wheel forward and reverse rotation.

Then we use TB6612FNG that make use can control wheel by pwm signal.
